function [stewart] = initializeStewartPose(stewart, args)
% initializeStewartPose - Determine the initial stroke in each leg to have the wanted pose
%                         It uses the inverse kinematic
%
% Syntax: [stewart] = initializeStewartPose(stewart, args)
%
% Inputs:
%    - stewart - A structure with the following fields
%        - Aa   [3x6] - The positions ai expressed in {A}
%        - Bb   [3x6] - The positions bi expressed in {B}
%    - args - Can have the following fields:
%        - AP   [3x1] - The wanted position of {B} with respect to {A}
%        - ARB  [3x3] - The rotation matrix that gives the wanted orientation of {B} with respect to {A}
%
% Outputs:
%    - stewart - updated Stewart structure with the added fields:
%      - dLi[6x1] - The 6 needed displacement of the struts from the initial position in [m] to have the wanted pose of {B} w.r.t. {A}
